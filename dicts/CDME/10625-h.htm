<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> present work is intended to
meet, in some measure, the requirements of those who wish to make some
study of Middle-English, and who find a difficulty in obtaining such
assistance as will enable them to find out the meanings and etymologies
of the words most essential to their purpose.</p>

<p>The best Middle-English Dictionary, that by Dr. Mätzner of Berlin,
has only reached the end of the letter H; and it is probable that it
will not be completed for many years. The only Middle-English Dictionary
that has been carried on to the end of the alphabet is that by the late
Dr. Stratmann, of Krefeld. This is a valuable work, and is indispensable
for the more advanced student. However, the present work will still
supply a deficiency, as it differs from Stratmann’s Dictionary in many
particulars. We have chosen as our Main Words, where possible, the most
typical of the forms or spellings of the period of Chaucer and Piers
Plowman; in Stratmann, on the other hand, the form chosen as Main Word
is generally the oldest form in which it appears, frequently one of the
twelfth century. Moreover, with regard to authorities, we refer in the
case of the great majority of our forms to a few, cheap, easily
accessible works, whereas Stratmann’s authorities are mainly the
numerous and expensive publications of the Early English Text Society.
Lastly, we have paid special attention to the French element in
Middle-English, whereas Stratmann is somewhat deficient in respect of
words of French origin<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a>. The book which has generally been found of most
assistance to the learner is probably Halliwell’s Dictionary of Archaic
and Provincial Words; but this is not specially confined to the
Middle-English period, and the plan of it differs in several respects
from that of the present work.</p>

<p>The scope of this volume will be best understood by an explanation of
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
the circumstances that gave rise to it. Some useful and comparatively
inexpensive volumes illustrative of the Middle-English period have been
issued by the Clarendon Press; all of which are furnished with
glossaries, explaining all the important words, with exact references to
the passages wherein the words occur. In particular, the three useful
hand-books containing Specimens of English (from 1150 down to 1580)
together supply no less than sixty-seven characteristic extracts from
the most important literary monuments of this period; and the three
glossaries to these books together fill more than 370 pages of
closely-printed type in double columns. The idea suggested itself that
it would be highly desirable to bring the very useful information thus
already collected <i>under one alphabet</i>, and this has now been
effected. At the same time, a&nbsp;reference has in every case been
carefully given to the <i>particular</i> Glossarial Index which
registers each form here cited, so that it is perfectly easy for any one
who consults our book to refer, not merely to the particular Index thus
noted, but to the references given in that Index; and so, by means of
such references, to find every passage referred to, with its proper
context. Moreover the student only requires, for this purpose,
a&nbsp;small array of the text-books in the Clarendon Press Series,
instead of a more or less complete set of editions of Middle-English
texts, the possession of which necessitates a considerable outlay of
money. By this plan, so great a <i>compression</i> of information has
been achieved, that a large number of the articles give a summary such
as can be readily expanded to a considerable length, by the exercise of
a very little trouble; and thus the work is practically as full of
material as if it had been three or four times its present size.
A&nbsp;couple of examples will shew what this really means.</p>

<p>At p. 26 is the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<b>Bi-heste</b>, <i>sb.</i> promise, S, S2, C2, P; <b>byheste</b>,
S2; <b>beheste</b>, S2; <b>byhest</b>, S2; <b>bihese</b>, S;
<b>biheest</b>, W; <b>bihese</b>, <i>pl.</i>, S.&mdash;AS.
<i>be-hǽs</i>.’</p>

<p>By referring to the respective indexes here cited, such as S
(=&nbsp;Glossary to Specimens of English, Part&nbsp;I), and the like, we
easily expand this article into the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<b>Bi-heste</b>, <i>sb.</i> promise, S (9. 19); S2 (1<i>a</i>. 184);
C2 (B&nbsp;37, 41, 42, F 698); P (3. 126); <b>byheste</b>, S2
(18<i>b</i>. 25); <b>beheste</b>, S2 (14<i>a</i>.&nbsp;3);
<b>byhest</b>, S2 (12. 57, 18<i>b</i>. 9, [where it may also be
explained by <i>grant</i>]); <b>bihese</b>, S (where it is used as a
plural); <b>biheest</b>, W (promise, command, Lk. xxiv. 49, Rom. iv. 13;
pl. <i>biheestis</i>, Heb. xi. 13); <b>bihese</b>, S (<i>pl.</i>
behests, promises, 4<i>d</i>. 55).&mdash;AS. <i>behǽs</i>.’</p>

<p>In order to exhibit the full meaning of this&mdash;which requires no
further
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
explanation to those who have in hand the books denoted by S, S2,
&amp;c.&mdash;it would be necessary to print the article at considerable
length, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<b>Biheste</b>, <i>sb.</i> promise; “dusi <i>biheste</i>”
a&nbsp;foolish promise, (extract from) Ancren Riwle, l.&nbsp;19; “and
wel lute wule hulde þe <i>biheste</i> þat he nom,” (extract from) Robert
of Gloucester, l.&nbsp;184; “holdeth your <i>biheste</i>,” Chaucer,
Introd. to Man of Law’s Prologue, l.&nbsp;37; “<i>biheste</i> is dette,”
same, l.&nbsp;41; “al my <i>biheste</i>” same, l.&nbsp;42; “or breken
his <i>biheste</i>” Chaucer, sequel to Squieres Tale, l.&nbsp;698; “þorw
fals <i>biheste</i>,” Piers Plowman, Text B, Pass. iii, l.&nbsp;126; “to
vol-vulle (fulfil) þat <i>byheste</i>” Trevisa (extract from), lib. vi.
cap. 29, l.&nbsp;25; “the lond of promyssioun, or of <i>beheste</i>,”
Prol. to Mandeville’s Travels, l.&nbsp;3; “wiþ fair <i>by-hest</i>,”
William and the Werwolf, l.&nbsp;57; “þe <i>byhest</i> (promise,
<i>or</i> grant) of oþere menne kyngdom,” Trevisa, lib. vi. cap. 29,
l.&nbsp;9; “y schal sende the <i>biheest</i> of my fadir in-to ȝou,”
Wyclif, Luke xxiv. 49; “not bi the lawe is <i>biheest</i> to Abraham,”
Wycl. Rom. iv. 13; “whanne the <i>biheestis</i> weren not takun,” Wycl.
Heb. xi. 13; “longenge to godes <i>bihese</i>” Old Eng. Homilies,
Dominica iv. post Pascha, l.&nbsp;55.’</p>

<p>We thus obtain fifteen excellent examples of the use of this word,
with the full context and an exact reference (easily verified) in every
case. And, in the above instance, all the quotations lie within the
compass of the eleven texts in the Clarendon Press Series denoted,
respectively, by S, S2, S3, C, C2, C3, W, W2, P, H, and&nbsp;G.</p>

<p>The original design was to make use of these text-books only; but it
was so easy to extend it by including examples to be obtained from other
Glossaries and Dictionaries, that a considerable selection of
interesting words was added from these, mainly for the sake of
illustrating the words in the Clarendon text-books. These illustrative
words can be fully or partially verified by those who happen to possess
all or some of the works cited, or they can safely be taken on trust, as
really occurring there, any mistake being due to such authority.</p>

<p>A second example will make this clearer. ‘<b>Brant</b>, <i>adj.</i>
steep, high, MD, HD; <b>brent</b>, JD; <b>brentest</b>, <i>superl.</i>
S2.&mdash;AS. <i>brant</i> (<i>bront</i>); cp. Swed. <i>brant</i>, Icel.
<i>brattr</i>.’</p>

<p>Omitting the etymology, the above information is given in two short
lines. Those who possess the ‘Specimens of English’ will easily find the
example of the superl. <i>brentest</i>. By consulting Mätzner’s,
Halliwell’s, and Jamieson’s Dictionaries, further information can be
obtained, and the full article will appear as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<b>Brant</b>, <i>adj.</i> steep, high, MD [<b>brant</b>,
<b>brent</b>, <i>adj.</i> ags. <i>brand</i>, arduus,
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>

p.&nbsp;25: steil, hoch.&mdash;“Apon the bald Bucifelon <i>brant</i> up

ware als <i>brant</i> upritȝe as thay had bene walles,” MS. quoted in
Halliwell’s Dict., p.&nbsp;206; “Hyȝe bonkkes &amp; <i>brent</i>,”
Gawain and the Grene Knight, l.&nbsp;2165; “Bowed to þe hyȝ bonk þer
<i>brentest</i> hit wern,” Alliterative Poems, ed. Morris, Poem B,
l.&nbsp;379]; HD [<b>brant</b>, steep. <i>North</i>: “Brant against
Flodden Hill,” explained by Nares from Ascham, “up the steep side;” cf.
Brit. Bibl. i. 132, same as <i>brandly</i>?&mdash;“And thane thay com
tille wonder heghe mountaynes, and it semed as the toppes had towched
the firmament; and thir mountaynes were als <i>brant</i> upriȝte as thay
had bene walles, so that ther was na clymbyng upon thame,” Life of
Alexander, MS. Lincoln, fol. 38]; JD [<b>brent</b>, <i>adj.</i> high,
straight, upright; “My bak, that sumtyme <i>brent</i> hes bene, Now
cruikis lyk are camok tre,” Maitland Poems, p.&nbsp;193; <i>followed by
a discussion extending to more than 160 lines of small print, which we
forbear to quote</i>]; <b>brentest</b>, <i>superl.</i> S2. 13. 379 [“And
bowed to þe hyȝ bonk þer <i>brentest</i> hit were (MS. wern),” Allit.
Poems, l.&nbsp;379; <i>already cited in</i> Mätzner, <i>above</i>].’</p>

<p>The work, in fact, contains a very large collection of words, in many
variant forms, appearing in English literature and in Glossaries between
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1150 and <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1580. The glossaries in S2, S3 (Specimens of
English, 1298-1393, and 1394-1579) have furnished a considerable number
of words belonging to the Scottish dialect, which most dictionaries
(excepting of course that of Jamieson) omit.</p>

<p>The words are so arranged that even the beginner will, in general,
easily find what he wants. We have included in one article, together
with the Main Word, all the variant spellings of the glossaries, as well
as the etymological information. We have also given in alphabetical
order numerous cross-references to facilitate the finding of most of the
variant forms, and to connect them with the Main Word. In this way, the
arrangement is at once etymological and alphabetical&mdash;adapted to
the needs of the student of the language and of the student of the
literature.</p>

<p>The meanings of the words are given in modern English, directly after
the Main Word. The variant forms, as given in their alphabetical
position, are frequently also explained, thus saving (in such cases) the
trouble of a cross-reference, if the meaning of the word is alone
required.</p>

<p>An attempt is made in most cases to give the etymology, so far at
least as to shew the immediate source of the Middle-English word.
Especial pains have been taken with the words of French origin, which
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
form so large a portion of the vocabulary of the Middle-English period.
In many cases the AF (Anglo-French) forms are cited, from my list of
English Words found in Anglo-French, as published for the Philological
Society in 1882.</p>

<p>The student of English who wishes to trace back the history of a word
still in use can, in general, find the Middle-English form in Skeat’s
Etymological Dictionary, and will then be able to consult the present
work in order to obtain further instances of its early use.</p>

<p>The relative share of the authors in the preparation of this work is
easily explained. The whole of it in its present form (with the
exception of the letter&nbsp;N) was compiled, prepared, and written out
for press by Mr. Mayhew. The original plan was, however, my own; and I
began by writing out the letter N (since augmented) by way of experiment
and model. It will thus be seen that Mr. Mayhew’s share of the work has
been incomparably the larger, involving all that is most laborious. On
the other hand, I may claim that much of the labour was mine also, at a
much earlier stage, as having originally compiled or revised the
glossaries marked S2, S3, C2, C3, W, W2, P, and G, as well as the very
full glossarial indexes cited as B, PP, and WA, and the dictionary cited
as SkD. The important glossary marked S was, however, originally the
work of Dr. Morris (since re-written by Mr. Mayhew), and may, in a
sense, be said to be the back-bone of the whole, from its supplying a
very large number of the most curious and important early forms.</p>

<p>The material used has been carefully revised by both authors, so that
they must be held to be jointly responsible for the final form in which
the whole is now offered to the public.</p>

A new and thoroughly revised edition of Stratmann’s Dictionary is being

Press.</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "phonology" id = "phonology">
Note On The Phonology Of Middle-English.</a></h4>

<p>One great difficulty in finding a Middle-English word in this, or any
other, Dictionary is due to the frequent variation of the symbols
denoting the vowel-sounds. Throughout the whole of the period to which
the work relates the symbols <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>, in particular, are
constantly interchanged, whether they stand alone, or form parts of
diphthongs. Consequently, words which are spelt with one of these
symbols in a given text must frequently be looked for as if spelt with
the other; i.e. the pairs of symbols <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>, <i>ai</i>
and <i>ay</i>, <i>ei</i> and <i>ey</i>, <i>oi</i> and <i>oy</i>,
<i>ui</i> and <i>uy</i>, must be looked upon as likely to be used
indifferently, one for the other. For further information, the student
should consult the remarks upon Phonology in the Specimens of English
(1150 to 1300), 2nd ed., p.&nbsp;xxv. For those who
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
have not time or opportunity to do this, a&nbsp;few brief notes may
perhaps suffice.</p>

<p>The following symbols are frequently confused, or are employed as
equivalent to each other because they result from the same sound in the
Oldest English or in Anglo-French:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p><i>i</i>, <i>y</i>;&mdash;<i>ai</i>, <i>ay</i>;&mdash;<i>ei</i>,
<i>ey</i>;&mdash;<i>oi</i>, <i>oy</i>;&mdash;<i>ui</i>, <i>uy</i>.</p>

<p><i>a</i>, <i>o</i>;&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>æ</i>, <i>e</i>,
<i>ea</i>;&mdash;<i>e</i>, <i>eo</i>, <i>ie</i>;&mdash;<i>o</i>,
<i>u</i>, <i>ou</i>;&mdash;(all originally short).</p>

<p><i>a</i>, <i>æ</i>, <i>ea</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>ee</i>;&mdash;<i>e</i>,
<i>ee</i>, <i>eo</i>, <i>ie</i>;&mdash;<i>o</i>, <i>oo</i>,
<i>oa</i>;&mdash;<i>u</i>, <i>ou</i>, <i>ui</i>;&mdash;(all long).</p>
</div>

<p>These are the most usual interchanges of symbols, and will commonly
suffice for practical purposes, in cases where the cross-references
fail. If the word be not found after such substitutions have been
allowed for, it may be taken for granted that the Dictionary does not
contain it. As a fact, the Dictionary only contains a considerable
number of such words as are most common, or (for some special reason)
deserve notice; and it is at once conceded that it is but a small
hand-book, which does not pretend to exhibit in all its fulness the
extraordinarily copious vocabulary of our language at an important
period of its history. The student wishing for complete information will
find (in course of time) that the New English Dictionary which is being
brought out by the Clarendon Press will contain all words found in our
literature since the year 1100.</p>

<p>Of course variations in the vowel-sounds are also introduced, in the
case of strong verbs, by the usual ‘gradation’ due to their method of
conjugation. To meet this difficulty in some measure, numerous (but not
exhaustive) cross-references have been introduced, as when, e.g.
‘<b>Bar</b>, bare’ is given, with a cross-reference to <b>Beren</b>.
Further help in this respect is to be had from the table of 183 strong
verbs given at pp. lxix-lxxxi of the Preface to Part I of the Specimens
of English (2nd edition); see, in particular, the alphabetical index to
the same, at pp. lxxxi, lxxxii. The same Preface further contains some
account of the three principal Middle-English dialects (p.&nbsp;xl), and
Outlines of the Grammar (p.&nbsp;xlv). It also explains the meaning of
the symbols þ, ð (both used for <i>th</i>), ȝ (used for <i>y</i>
initially, <i>gh</i> medially, and <i>gh</i> or <i>z</i> finally), with
other necessary information.</p>

<h4><a name = "symbols" id = "symbols">SYMBOLS.</a></h4>

<p>In the etymological part three stops are used as symbols in connexion
with the cognate forms cited, namely the comma, the semi-colon, and the
colon. The comma is used to connect various spellings of a word, as well
as parallel forms cited from nearly connected languages; for instance,
s.v. <b>daunger</b>, the OF. forms are so connected. The semi-colon
between two forms denotes that the two forms are phonetically
equivalent, and that the preceding one is directly derived from, and is
historically connected with the one following this symbol; for instance,
s.v. <b>bugle</b>, the OF. <i>bugle</i> is the phonetic equivalent of
the Lat. <i>buculum</i>, and is immediately derived therefrom. The colon
between two forms denotes that the two forms are phonetically
equivalent, and that the form following this symbol is an earlier, more
primitive form than the one preceding, without an immediate
interborrowing between the languages being asserted; for instance, s.v.
<b>demen</b>, the Goth. <i>dómjan</i> is an older form than the AS.
<i>déman</i>, but <i>déman</i> is not borrowed from the Gothic. The
abbreviation ‘cp.’ introduces other cognate forms, and has the same
value as the symbol + in Skeat’s Dictionaries.</p>

<p>The asterisk * at the beginning of a word denotes a theoretical form,
assumed (upon scientific principles) to have formerly existed. The sign
= is to be read ‘a translation of.’ ‘(<i>n</i>)’ after Prompt., Cath.
and other authorities refers to foot-notes or other notes citing the
form in question.</p>

<p>Typographical errors are shown in the text with <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘mosue’">mouse-hover popups</ins>. Most errors are
trivial, such as missing or incorrect punctuation or misplaced italics.
Variant abbreviations such as “O.H.G.” for “OHG.” have been regularized
to the forms given in the Authorities and Language lists. The word
“invisible” in corrections means that there is an appropriately sized

<h5><a name = "alphabet" id = "alphabet">
Alphabetization in the Dictionary</a></h5>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, words are spelled and alphabetized as
originally printed. Note in particular:</p>

<p class = "inset">
The letter <b>Æ æ</b> is alphabetized as <b>ae</b>.</p>

<p class = "inset">
The letter <b>I</b> is alphabetized according to its phonetic value,
vowel before consonant. <b>J</b> is not used.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Thorn <b>Þ þ</b> and eth <b>ð</b> (capital <b>Ð</b> does not occur) are
alphabetized as <b>th</b>.</p>

<p class = "inset">
The letters <b>U</b> and <b>V</b> are shown with the <i>form</i> used in
their source documents, but are <i>alphabetized</i> by phonetic value.
A&nbsp;few sequences such as initial <b>Su-</b> do not make this
distinction.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Yogh <b>Ȝ ȝ</b> is alphabetized after <b>y</b>.</p>

<h5><a name = "anchors" id = "anchors">
Cross-References</a></h5>

<p>All cross-references are linked directly to the referenced word. When
the word is located in your current file (A-F, G-Q, R-Ȝ) the link is
<a class = "plain" href = "#anchors">highlighted</a>; when it is in one of
the two other files, the link is <a class = "external" href =
"#anchors">underlined</a>. <i>These settings may be overridden by your
personal browser preferences.</i> Your browser may take a short while to
find the word, especially if it is opening a file for the first time, so
you will generally see the beginning of the new file before being taken
to the right location.</p>

<p>When there is an error in the cross-reference, the word is shown in
its original form, while the link leads to the correct form. Simple
corrections are shown in <ins class = "mycorr" title = "like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>
with two standard wordings: <b>headword spelled ‘Mous’</b> means that
the referenced form exists but is not the primary entry; <b>error for
‘Mous’</b> means that the spelling in the cross-reference is not used.</p>

<p>Most errors are minor lapses in editing, such as adding or omitting a
final <b>e</b> or <b>n</b> (in verbs), or forgetting that the text does
not use the letter <b>J</b>. More serious errors, such as references to
words that could not be found in the Dictionary, are explained in
separate paragraphs immediately following the entry.</p>


<h5><i>Technical Note</i></h5>

<p>Anchors of Dictionary headwords are in the form <b>word_entry</b>
(lower case) with these modifications:</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; <b>æ</b>, <b>ð</b>, <b>þ</b>, <b>ȝ</b> have been expanded to ae,
dh, th, gh</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; diacritical marks and medial hyphens have been omitted</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; spaces (only in phrases) have been changed to _ lines</p>

<p class = "inset">
&mdash; duplicate headwords are identified by part of speech and, if
necessary, by number: <b>word_thanne_adv</b>; <b>word_on_prefix_1</b>.
If the text uses numbers, as with groups of identically spelled
prefixes, the anchor will use the same number.</p>

<h5><a name = "hyphens" id = "hyphens">Hyphens At Line-End</a></h5>

<p>The book’s two-column format resulted in a great many line-end
hyphens. Most hyphenated words were unique, so the ordinary tests (“Is
this word, or a structurally similar one, hyphenated on its other
occurrences?”) could seldom be used.</p>

<p>Line-end hyphens in cross-references (“see”, “see also”, “cf.”) were
kept or omitted based on the form of the cross-referenced headword. Note
that hyphenization in this situation is very inconsistent. Except in the
Additions, cross-references often omit a mid-line hyphen that is present
in the referenced word, or include one that is absent.</p>

<p>Line-end hyphens were retained in past participles in <b>i-</b>,
<b>y-</b> and equivalent, and after the prefixes <b>out-</b> and
<b>to-</b>; they were omitted before common endings such as
<b>-lich</b>, <b>-ship</b>, <b>-ness</b>, <b>-full</b>. They were
removed after Middle English <b>un-</b>, but retained after Anglo-Saxon
<b>un-</b>.</p>

<p>The remaining line-end hyphens were omitted <i>unless</i> they were
in the same location (morphological boundary) as the hyphen in the
headword, or if the hyphenated word was a compound. Within these two
groups, final decisions were based on more fluid criteria such as
internal consistency within an entry, or hyphenization of other words
from the same source. Words printed with these types of ambiguous
hyphens are <span class = "hyphen">lightly underlined</span> in the
e-text. The position of omitted hyphens is generally obvious, and has
not been explicitly marked.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
