<h1 class="smo">Cloning multidict.net</h1>

<p>All the <i>software</i> which would be required to set up a clone of the multidict.net service is freely available as a Github project, at <a href="//github.com/caoimhinsmo/multidict">https://github.com/caoimhinsmo/github</a>.  This includes all the PHP programs, Javascript programs, and CSS stylesheets.  It can be set up in a few seconds on a new server using git.  It is public-licenced, so people are free to take bits of it to use and alter as they wish.</p>

<p>However, there is a LOT more to involved in setting up the service than simply the software. It is not a trivial undertaking and would likely require several weeks of work.  For example, URL rewrite rules need to be set up in the Apache2 configuration (or Nginx or whatever webserver software you use). Certain optional Apache (or whatever) modules need to be installed. The PHP configuration needs to be changed to raise various limits and change the include path. The PHP programs use certain PEAR packages, so PEAR has to be set up and the packages imported. Database connector shim classes need to be set up in PHP. For lemmatization in Multidict to work fully, it requires Hunspell and Hunspell dictionary files for many languages. Japanese requires Mecab.  From having done it several times, I have kept <a href="multidict_cloning.docx">Multidict cloning</a> notes, but these are really only an aide memoire, because what is actually required will depend on your actual platform, and on the way in which the computing world has since changed.</p>

<p>The software is nothing without the associated multidict database, running in MySQL or MariaDB or equivalent, so this has to be set up. So too do the database userids and passwords required to connect to it, matching the PHP connector shims.  The file <a href="multidict_structure.sql">multidict_structure.sql</a> is sufficient to set up the <i>structure</i> of the database, as it was at the time of writing.  However, this is lacking the actual <i>data</i> including the following: the table with the current connection paramters for hundreds of online dictionaries; the enormous lemmatization table which has been gathered with lemmatizations for many languages; the page indexes necessary for connecting to many online page-image dictionaries at WebArchive and elsewhere; the custom dictionaries hosted in Multidict itself; the Clilstore units themselves with their texts, any uploaded files, records of ownership, etc; the Clilstore user table with encrypted passwords, etc. This is not included here, for many reasons including that it contains mildly confidential data, including records of login times. In effect, if I were to die suddenly, anyone wishing to take over the service to ensure its continuity into the future should contact Màrtainn Dòmhnallach, head of computing at SMO, to either take over the service wholesale or to get a copy of the entire database.</p>

<p>The user interface in its many languages requires the Smotr localization system, so that would have to be cloned too. Even the default English interface would be barely usable without Smotr, because the default strings in most cases are severely abbreviated versions of the full message string.  Smotr is also publicly available on Github, at <a href="//github.com/caoimhinsmo/smotr/">https://github.com/caoimhinsmo/smotr</a>.</p>
