    <p>Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Department of Homeland Security 
    suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several 
    categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some 
    to be granted permanent residency. Most disturbing was the stated rationale. 
    This was being proposed
    <a href="http://www2.nationalreview.com/memo_UCIS_072910.html" target>&quot;in 
    the absence of Comprehensive Immigration Reform.&quot;</a> In other words, 
    because Congress refuses to do what these bureaucrats would like to see done, 
    they will legislate it themselves. </p>
    <p>Regardless of your feelings on the substance of the immigration issue, 
    this is not how a constitutional democracy should operate. Administrators 
    administer the law, they don't change it. That's the legislators' job. </p>
    <p>When questioned, the
    <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/30/gop-lawmakers-want-explanation-draft-memo-amnesty-thousands/" target>
    White House played down the toxic memo</a>, leaving the impression that it 
    was nothing more than ruminations emanating from the bowels of Homeland 
    Security. But the administration is engaged in an even more significant 
    power play elsewhere. </p>
    <p>A
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040200487.html" target>
    2007 Supreme Court ruling gave the Environmental Protection Agency</a> the 
    authority to regulate carbon emissions if it could demonstrate that they 
    threaten human health and the environment. The Obama EPA made precisely that 
    finding, thereby granting itself a huge expansion of power and, noted The 
    Post, sending &quot;a message to Congress.&quot; </p>
    <p>It was not a terribly subtle message:
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/03/AR2010080306366.html" target>
    Enact cap-and-trade legislation</a> -- taxing and heavily regulating carbon-based 
    energy -- or the EPA will do so unilaterally. As Frank O'Donnell of Clean 
    Air Watch noted, such a finding &quot;is likely to help
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/03/AR2010080306366.html" target>
    light a fire under Congress</a> to get moving.&quot; </p>
    <p>Well, Congress didn't. Despite the &quot;regulatory cudgel&quot; (to again quote 
    The Post) the administration has been waving, the Senate has repeatedly 
    refused to acquiesce. </p>
    <p>Good for the Senate. But what to do when the executive is passively 
    aggressive rather than actively so? Take
    <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/21/kyl-obama-wont-secure-border-lawmakers-immigration-package/" target>
    border security. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.)</a> reports that President Obama 
    told him about
    <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/232449/kyl-obama-did-not-consult-border-funds-robert-costa" target>
    pressure from his political left</a> and its concern that if the border is 
    secured, Republicans will have no incentive to support comprehensive reform 
    (i.e., amnesty). Indeed, Homeland Security's
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/16/AR2010031603573.html" target>
    abandonment of the &quot;virtual fence&quot;</a> on the southern border, combined with 
    its lack of interest in completing the real fence that today covers only 
    one-third of the border, gives the distinct impression that serious border 
    enforcement is not a high administration priority absent some Republican 
    quid pro quo on comprehensive reform. </p>
    <p>But border enforcement is not something to be manipulated in return for 
    legislative favors. It is, as the administration vociferously
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070601928.html" target>
    argued in court in the Arizona case</a>, the federal executive's 
    constitutional responsibility. Its job is to faithfully execute the laws. 
    Non-execution is a dereliction of duty. </p>
    <p>This contagion of executive willfulness is not confined to the federal 
    government or to Democrats. In Virginia, the Republican attorney general has 
    just issued a ruling
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080205229.html" target>
    allowing police to ask about one's immigration status</a> when stopped for 
    some other reason (e.g., a traffic violation). Heretofore, police could 
    inquire only upon arrest and imprisonment. </p>
    <p>Whatever your views about the result, the process is suspect. If police 
    latitude regarding the interrogation of possible illegal immigrants is to be 
    expanded, that's an issue for the legislature, not the executive. </p>
    <p>How did we get here? I blame Henry Paulson. (Such a versatile sentence.) 
    The gold standard of executive overreach was achieved the day he summoned 
    the heads of the country's nine largest banks and informed them that 
    henceforth the
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/13/AR2008101300184.html" target>
    federal government was their business partner</a>. The banks were under no 
    legal obligation to obey. But they know the capacity of the federal 
    government, when crossed, to cause you trouble, endless trouble. They 
    complied. </p>
    <p>So did BP when the president summoned its top executives to the White 
    House to demand a
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/16/AR2010061602614.html" target>
    $20 billion federally administered escrow fund for damages</a>. Existing law 
    capped damages at $75 million. BP, like the banks, understood the power of 
    the U.S. government. Twenty billion it was. </p>
    <p>Again, you can be pleased with the result (I was) and still be troubled 
    by how we got there. Everyone wants energy in the executive (as
    <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a2_1_1s13.html" target>
    Alexander Hamilton called it</a>). But not lawlessness. In the modern 
    welfare state, government has the power to regulate your life. That's bad 
    enough. But at least there is one restraint on this bloated power: the <i>
    separation</i> of powers. Such constraints on your life must first be 
    approved by both houses of Congress. </p>
    <p>That's called the consent of the governed. The constitutional order is 
    meant to subject you to the will of the people's representatives, not to the 
    whim of a chief executive or the imagination of a loophole-seeking 
    bureaucrat.
